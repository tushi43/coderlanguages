		<p style="margin:5px;">Hello, I'm Tushar Jumani, currently a third year computer engineering student in VESIT, who has made this website.<br> This is the website which aims to provide you with all directions or links to resources and to make you aware about all the terms and some tips which I have collected through my experiences throughout my coding venture. At start I was clueless about coding then I was seaching for a website where I can get to know all the resouces where to approach, where to search for content and many more issues, there were none. Hence, I tried my best to make a website like what I needed when someone want to start his/her coding venture. Problem Solved!!<br>
		 This website is used making BootStrap 3.0(CSS framework), Angular JS, PHP and ofcourse plently of HTML and CSS. I have used AngularJS to make this a SPA(Single Page Application). Usage of Bootstrap because I wanted to make this website mobile-friendly. It took me around three months (Everyday around 5 hours) to develop the website, I know it took me much more time but I'm happy finally I have completed my another project. I always see the problems around me and then try to solve them,this website is also one of them.
		 <br>
		 For most of the content for languages and framework, I have referred different websites like Wikipedia, w3schools and many more. Each other website referred, I have provided the link on the same page. No new content is created by me, It's all integration of different resources.
		 <br>
		 Hope You'll like it!!<br>
		 Do Let me Know your feedback or any suggestion or any error in Any Query Page!!
