<h1><!--Name-->Editors:</h1>
It lets you read, write your code and save it in your device on a particular folder with a desired file extension so you can further compile or interpret that file. Each device(Like Laptop/Personal Computer(PC)) has a default editor like Notepad in Windows, gedit in Ubuntu or TextEdit in Mac.
<br>
<h1>Why do we need editors?</h1>
As a programmer, you will definitely need a advance editor for your project in near future. While starting to code you must be able to write, save and run the program with default editors. But as you start a new project you must be able to switch to advance editors because they provide you many features which are not possible in default editors. You should not start the very basic program with advance editor because they provide you with basic syntax or popularly called skeleton of program which makes you habitual of using it and sometimes in an interview or when anyone says to write simple program on white board syntax error usually occurs. This can be problem. But when you are able to write small basic programs like sorting or program with functions which can be compiled/interpret without any error you can switch to different editors.
<br>
Always indent your code because it make the code readable and easy to understand for anyone. This is one major reason why Python is famous because you need to indent the code, otherwise it won't run. Indentation makes debugging easier.<br>
Benefits of using advance editors:
<ul><li>When you will write huge programs which is of hundred or thousands of lines it helps you with defining line on which error occurs as many interpret says "error at line number 870"(example) </li> 
<li>It helps you detect or suggest keywords or next statement that should be written in your code. It really saves time.</li>
<li>It helps you to have access over Plugins which ease the work.</li>
<li>It gives many options like seeing Document Map. You can open an entire folder. You can do changes in multiple part at once and many more000.</li>
<li>It helps you change the color of editor i.e., enables to change color of your workspace.</li>

<i>Suggestion:</i> Always use Black background and white color text in your editor because as you start coding you need to work for many hours in a go. So to reduce strain on your eyes you must do the change, it really helps a lot.

<br>
Each and every editor has its own features and advantages. They provide a wide variety of options.
