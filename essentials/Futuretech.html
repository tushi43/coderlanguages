	<h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>
		<p class="well">" Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals." -WikiPedia<br>
		It is simply the machine taking decisions on its own without human intervention, It gives the ability to machine to think and take action. There are two groups, one which say AI is beneficial and others say AI will destroy human jobs and Machines will rule the world just like movie <i>Terminator</i>.<br> I do belong to first group as I think machines always automate the process, New different jobs will be generated. AI will be one of the most useful thing in future, when using Demilitarize AI.

		<h3>Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
		<p class="well">
		Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning is a field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" with data. For this, a huge amount of data is passed to machine to give better result by analyzing the data.<br> Python, Java, and R are most popular skills to learn for mastering Machine Learning.

		<h3>Natura Language Processing (NLP)</h3>
		<p class="well">
		Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of research and application that explores how computers can be used to understand and manipulate natural language text or speech to do useful things. It is widely used to check emotions of people by reading the reviews which automatically rank the product. It can be used to detect fake reviews or autogenerated article by using semantic analysis.<br> Applications of NLP include a number of fields of studies, such as machine translation, natural language text processing and summarization, user interfaces, multilingual and cross language information retrieval (CLIR), speech recognition, artificial intelligence and expert systems, and many more. <br> You can use Python and Java for NLP or softwares like OpenNLP, CoreNLP, Mahout and more.

		<h3>Data Science </h3>
		<p class="well">
		" Data science is an interdisciplinary field of scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining " -WikiPedia<br>
		In simple words, data science is nothing but extracting meaningful information from lots of data available. Data Science is the science that uses smart mathematical and statistical models to mine information from data.
		It is a broader term which includes many things, you can see above image.

		<h3>Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality </h3>
		<p class="well">
		Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-generated scenario that simulates experience through senses and perception. This computer-generated scenarios can be very useful for practising in case of pilots,to explore exotic places where risk of dying is high(example on top of volcano),to treat patients and many more. VR has become a huge gaming sector with the release of Occulus Rift. The VR gaming is becoming popular day by day. Best software is Unity-3D to start with VR. The main focus is n the position and timing of graphics which is difficult.<br> Augmented reality (AR) systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images. The best example of AR is Pokemon Go game. Now you can relate with above statement. AR seems to be fun to me.
