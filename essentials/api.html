	<h1><!--Name-->Applicaton Programming Interface(API)</h1>
	<p>API is using someone's data or service to provide or built an application. The API can be free or you need to buy for getting the access. Simple API codes are avaliable you just need to change according to your own changes. In this site also, I have used the YouTube API and Google charts API for fun and making site's UI better<br>
	Down below is one of the best video which describes API as it best</p>
	<div class="container">
		<iframe
		src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s7wmiS2mSXY" 
		frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" 
		allowfullscreen class="video" style="display:block; margin:auto; ">
		</iframe>
	</div>
	<p>After you have watched the video, read the following scenario and try to understand with analogy :<br>
	The menu is front-end built using HTML,CSS and other languages.
	The waiter is doing the HTTP services because on internet either SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) or REST(REpresentational State Transfer) type of web services of getting or putting data.
	The cook is a programmer or machine which process the data according to instructions from customer and make the dish. that what programmers do,custom application!<br>
	For processing data any language can be used like Python, Java or any other.<br>
	The grocery or inventory is your main data which is processed, this data is pickup using SQL languages.
	This scenario simply shows how web works!!
	Thanks for reading!!
