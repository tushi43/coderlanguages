	<h1>Compilers and Interpreters</h1>
	<p>Machines are not able to understand human language and vice versa is true. Machines only understand the language of <i>0's</i>and <i>1's</i>, called as binary language. Hence, we make use of translators to make machine understand our language.<br> First there were Assemblers which converts the basic commands to machine language. Assembly language programs were difficult to code for complex logic, so with time High level languages were developed. With these High level languages comes translators like Compiler and Interpreter which converts High level language into assembly code and then converts into machine language.</p>
	<h1>Compilers</h1>
	<p>Compiler takes the code and process the entire code with six basic steps and gives output as assembly code. The languages which uses compiler for translation are called compiled languages. Some examples of compiled languages are C, C++ which are considered the fastest. Compilers are faster than interpreters because debugging(find and correcting the error) is easy, whole source code is compiled at once and all the errors are displayed.</p>
	<h1>Interpreters</h1>
	<p>Interpreter takes the code and process the code line by line until the entire code is translated. The interpretation stop when error is found. It does not proceed until the error is solved. The languages which uses Interpreter for translation are called interpreted languages. Some examples are PHP, JavaScript.<br>
	Some languages like Java does both compile and interpret the code. In Java, the sorce code is compiled and then bytecode is formed then bytecode is interpret by JVM(Java Virtual Machines).
