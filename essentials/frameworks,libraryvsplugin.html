	<h1>Frameworks vs Library vs Plugin</h1>
	<br>
	Many People confuse between Framework, Library and Plugin and most of the times they are used as an generic term. 
	<h2>This article will clear the understanding of all three terms:</h2>
	<h1>Framework:</h1>
	 Wikipedia define framework as:<br><br>
	<div class="well" style="color:black;">
		a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications.
	</div>
	In Simple words, Framework provides a basic skeleton which can be used for application and through this new application can be developed saving time,cost and effort. Framework may include libraries, APIs, tools, plugins and many more.<i>Framework</i> is a word that’s leaped to prominence in the last few years but now they’re the hot game to be playing. word seems to be merely a fashionable synonym for library, but the framework is a way bigger beast. From the name itself Frame gives a srtucture on which work(coding) needs to be done, Thus frame-work. The most crucial and important difference between Framework and Library is Flow of Control.  A framework inverts the flow of control, you hand over code to it, and wait for it to invoke the various callback functions that you provide. Many Frameworks provide features like Reusability, Extensibility, Structure, URLRouting, Database Manipulation, basic Security and Templates to application. Starting developing a application from scratch can be hectic task as it takes more time,money and work. We use framework everywhere whteher it is Qt for Desktop, Laravel for Web, Unity for games and TensorFlow for machine learning to reduce redundant work and to save time. You can clearly see the meaning of Inversion Of Control(IoC) in below video.

	</div>

	<h1>Library:</h1> Library is a set of functions that are called by coder when required and flow of control is in the hands of user/coder. A libraby may consists of one or many functions. The are used to reuse the code and eliminate redundant code. Libraries are particularly useful for storing frequently used routines/functions because you do not need to explicitly link them to every program that uses them. The linker automatically looks in libraries for routines that it does not find elsewhere.

	<h1>Plugin:</h1> 
		Wikipedia defines:<br><br>
	<div class="well" style="color:black;">
		a plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, addon, or extension) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program.  The common examples are the plug-ins used in web browsers to add new features such as search-engines, virus scanners, or the ability to use a new file type such as a new video format. Well-known browser plug-ins include the Adobe Flash Player, the QuickTime Player, and the Java plug-in, which can launch a user-activated Java applet on a web page to its execution on a local Java virtual machine.
	</div>
	A Plugin can be made by Third Party or by developer of an programming language. A plug-in is very useful to customize an application for desired output.
