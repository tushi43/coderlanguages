	<h2>Learning sites</h2>I would like to recommend
	<br>
	<p>
	There is lot of things available on the internet to learn any programming paradigm or Language. One of the best ways to learn is through reading a book and understanding then applying the knowledge. You can check was best suits you. There are plenty of material available for learning. At minimal level you have three ways to learn<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Books</li>
		<p>Books are one of the best thing to approach while studing because it helps with syntax as well as with knowlege about that particluar snippet of code, it makes you understand usage of that code with any examples, I have referred books for java and C which was very helpful.</p>
		<li>Documentation</li> 
		<p>When the technology/language is new in market and trending, you will not find any Videos instantly so referring to documentation helps, it also helps to explore all the great functions the language/framework possess. I have used documentation while learning PHP and Bootstrap. It also helps getting errors solved and also gives alternate methods/functions.</p>
		<li>Video Tutorials (You can refer YouTube/Udemy/Coursera)</li>
		<p>This is the one of best and easy method to learn any language but the problem is not every aspect is explained some little things are left behind. It's interactive and probably the best way to learn core concepts by experienced faculty.</p>
	</ol>
	These are some of the sites which have many good content to learn and understand better.

	<p>On coursera you will get all type of courses related to programming, design and many others. There are about 2,000 courses available on coursera in different fields and many good ones are of data science. Coursera works with universities and other organizations to offer online courses, specializations, and degrees in a variety of subjects.

	<p>Udemy is yet another good platform for learning through courses .It provides tools which enable users to create a course, promote it and earn money from student tuition charges. A important thing is <b>no Udemy courses are currently credentialed for college credit</b>, students take courses largely as a means of improving job-related skills.

If you are a computer engineer you will need to visit the site almost day. It has the best collection of basic problems and simple solutions to them. I ws developed by some students of IIT Roorkee.

	<p>If you want to start with web development,w3schools is the best in terms of syntax as well as their detailed meaning. Even many teachers refers to this site for teaching their students and I had also used this site when building this website. It is the world's largest web developer site. The inbuilt interpreter is very well design and you can try some different cde within that interpreter. The SQL is also precisely explained with all the major DBMS like SQL-Server, MySQL, Oracle DB and more. The bootstrap framework is also brilliantly explained with examples.</p>

	<p>While the above sites have coding courses as their part, codecademy is entire website dedicated to coding website. There are free as well as paid courses. Codecademy is an online freemium interactive platform that offers free coding classes in 12 different programming languages. The site also offers a paid "pro" option that gives users access to a personalized learning plan, quizzes, realistic projects, and live help from advisors</p>

The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers.

	<h2><img src="images/youtube_logo.png" height="80px" width="100px" >&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">YouTube</a></h2>
	<p>
	YouTube is the best place to find study material for anything, the reason is it's free and you must subscribe to channel. Just search for the topic and there is a series of videos often labelled as Tutorials series by various youtube channels. There are many good channels like thenewboston, codedamn, Traversy, DerekBanas, KhanAcademy, and more. My favourite is the thenewboston.
