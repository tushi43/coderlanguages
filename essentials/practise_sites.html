	<h2>Practise sites</h2>You must try atleast once!

	Coding is one of the thing which can be only improved by practise. There are tons of website which gives you platform to practise and learn, some have direct problems on basis of complexity, some provide real problems and some do it by presenting it in form of game. The only aim of all these websites is to make you better at coding.<br>  
	</p>
	<h3>Some popular practise sites are:</h3>
	<h2><img src="images/hackerrank_logo.jpg" height="50px" width="50px" >&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">HackerRank</a></h2>
	<p>HackerRank is one of the best websites to practise as it provide you many problems differentiated based on complexity and domains. It provides Better interface than many other websites and also in editorial section it provides solution with many ways to solve and also gives best time complexity to the problem. The HackerRank  <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/calendar" target="_blank" class="a1">Contest Calender</a> provide dates of various hackathon that you can participate and practise. This website also conducts various contest which are constraint to time. There are plenty of things available on HackerRank. HackerRank categorizes most of their programming challenges into a number of core computer science domains. Many hackathons are conducted by Major companies for recruiting on basis of preformance.<br>Pro Tip: <i>Whenever you want to run a piece of code and you don't have that language compiler you can go on HackerRank site go onto any problem select the language go for custom test input and paste the code in editor, you can easily see the output for code, Pretty Easy!!</i>
	<br> Explore as much as you can!! </p>
	<h2><img src="images/codechef_logo.png" height="130px" width="100px">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codechef.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">Codechef</a></h2><p>CodeChef is one of the oldest site for practising real life problems. It aims to provide a platform for students, young software professionals to practice, hone their programming skills through online contests. It doesn't have that good interface like others but is efficient.
	Many companies uses CodeChef to host CodeSprint/Hackathon. You can enroll in various certified courses offere by CodeChef to improve your skills.

	<h2><img src="images/HackerEarth_logo.png" height="50px" width="50px">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">HackerEarth</a></h2>
	<p>HackerEarth has a competitive programming platform which supports over 32 programming languages. HackerEarth is similar like HackerRank but it offers more when it comes to Hackathons, there are many hackathons/contest always avaliable to practise and improve. I don't see much difference between HackerEarth and HackerRank except for interface. </p>
	<h2><img src="images/topcoder_logo.png" height="50px" width="80px">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.topcoder.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">TopCoder</a></h2><p>Topcoder is oldest company which started competitive programming. Topcoder is a crowdsourcing company with a global open community of designers, developers, data scientists, and competitive programmers. It has a very good interface and also pay for any valuable contribution in project. Topcoder sells community services to corporate, mid-size, and small-business clients, and pays community members for their work on the projects. </p>
	<h2><img src="images/spoj_logo.jpeg" height="50px" width="50px">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.spoj.com/" target="_blank" class="a1">SPOJ</a></h2><p>SPOJ (Sphere Online Judge) is an online judge system, allows advanced users to organize contests under their own rules and also includes a forum where programmers can discuss how to solve a particular problem. The solution to problems can be submitted in over 40 programming languages, via the Sphere Engine(It's pretty good).</p>
	<h2><img src="images/gfg.jpg" height="50px" width="70px">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank" class="a1">GeeksforGeeks</a></h2><p>GeeksforGeeks is the Ultimate saviour for you if you want to learn and practise various problems. If you are a computer engineer you will need to visit the site almost day. It has the best collection of basic problems and simple solutions to them. I ws developed by some students of IIT Roorkee. It has various categories and also youtube channel for learning. The interview section also has the most asked questions with answers with quizzes and many more. Do explore the site!!</p>
