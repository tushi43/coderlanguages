<p>Just make sure you do not do mistake like above stated.
<ol>
<li>Talk with client as much as possible to gather requirements.</li>
<li>Have a good analysis of project/product you are building.</li>
<li>Build a better prototype</li>
<li>Code using comments, proper naming conventions and use Object Oriented Design (OO Design) which makes maintenance easy.</li>
<li>Do proper testing</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
 I'm saying this because I have suffered in my college project. This above all steps of Information gathering, analysis, design, coding, testing, maintenance are very important. When I design a paper prototype for next project it was really easy to code for that project. I had not done any information gathering before for which the my project suffers. Now, I don't.</p>
