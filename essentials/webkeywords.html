	<h1>Things You must Know while learning web development</h1>
	<h2>Website:</h2> A website is a collection of web pages built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more technologies which are linked together in a structure. A website may contain any type of multimedia, links, Information(content) for better user experience. <br>
	A website can be static or responsive/interactive. A interactive or responsive website is also know as <b>Mobile Website</b>.
	All the websites which can be seen using browser of smartphones are considered as Mobile websites. They are mobile-friendly to enhance user experience. <br><br>
	<h2>Web App(Web Application):</h2> They are specifically build for smartphones for users to use with ease as smartphone industry is increasing rapidly. They are built using web technologies. With advancement in technologies, Web apps look and feel very much like mobile(Native) apps. For Example, GMail which can be installed on any smartphone as an app, and can be accesed by any browser also. 
	<h2>Mobile/Native App:</h2> This apps are platform specific and are built using mobile technologies, for example iOS app is build using either Objective-C or Swift and Android apps are built using Android. For example, Clash Royale Game or any other game which are built specifically for smartphones. Native apps look and perform the best. They provide Multi touch,Fast graphics API, Fluid animation, Ease of use and best performance.  They exist outside of an individual’s browser, and have their own place on that person’s mobile home screen.
	<h2>Hybrid app:</h2> Hybrid mobile apps are like any other apps you’ll find on your phone. They install on your device. You can find them in app stores. With them, you can play games, engage your friends through social media, take photos, track your health, and much more. Hybrid apps provide the best of both worlds(Web app and native apps). PhoneGap is an example of the most popular container for creating hybrid mobile apps. We define hybrid as a web app, primarily built using HTML5 and JavaScript, that is then wrapped inside a thin native container that provides access to native platform features.
