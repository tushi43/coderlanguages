<h1><!--Name-->AJAX</h1>
<b>A</b>synchronous <b>J</b>avaScript <b>A</b>nd <b>X</b>ML is a new technique which describes how technologies like JavaScript, XML and Document Object Model(DOM) can be used together to create interactive web applications.
<br>
The AJAX applications eradicates the start-stop-start-stop nature or click, wait, and refresh criteria of the client-server interaction. Instead of loadin the web page during the beginning of the session, the browser loads the ASP engine, written in JavaScript, the web page sends its request using a javascript function. This JavaScript code makes a request to the server. The server response comprises of data and not the presentation, which implies that the data required by the page is provided by the server as the response, and the style of presentation is implemented on that data with the help of the markup language. Most of the web page does not change. Only part of the web page is changed is updated. the JavaScript dynamically updates the web page, without redrawing everything. For the web server nothing has changed. It still responds to each request, just as it does before. The JavaScript uses XMLHttpRequest object to exchange data asynchronously over the client and server. In short, the part that changes frequently in a web page is only change instead of refreshing or loading the whole web page which is in this case is overhead (Benefits of JavaScript!!).
AJAX applications are browser and platform-independent!

Google Suggest is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.
<br>Reddit use AJAX to handle all of the voting, so that the users are able to voice their opinions on a number of stories quickly and easily.
