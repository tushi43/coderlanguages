	<h1><!--Name-->Hibernate</h1>
	Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a mechanism that makes it possible to address, access and manipulate objects without having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources. In other words, ORM is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. Hibernate ORM or simply Hibernate is a java framework to interact with database. Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.  One of the major drawbacks of JDBC is that, one has to embed the applicationâ€™s data into the SQL syntax, i.e., for saving the data in an application, the business object has to be converted to relational-object model by embedding the various pieces of data within the SQL language syntax. hence, Hibernate is the solution to drawbacks of JDBC.
