<h1><!--Name-->JSON</h1>
<b>J</b>ava<b>S</b>cript <b>O</b>bject <b>N</b>otation is a lightweight data-interchange format and has syntax for storing and exchanging data. It is easy for humans to read and write. Also easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a language-independent data format. It was derived from JavaScript, but as of 2017 many programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. 
<br>
JSON is built on two structures:<br>
A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array.<br>
An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.<br>
JSON grew out of a need for stateful, real-time server-to-browser communication protocol without using browser plugins such as Flash or Java applets. Code for parsing and generating JSON data is readily available in many programming languages. JSON's website lists JSON libraries by language. You can view all languages that support JSON format on <a href="https://www.json.org/" target="_blank" class="a1">Official Website</a><br>
