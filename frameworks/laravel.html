<h1><!--Name-->Laravel</h1> 
Laravel is the most popular framework of PHP which is free and open-source web framework developed by Taylor Otwell. It consists of Symfony, Bootstrap framework . Laravel is now worldâ€™s most popular web-framework - surpassing nodejs or ruby or any other PHP framework. The software structure of laravel has made with emphasis on modularity. It follows MVC( Model-View-Controller ) architecture. It has authentication, routing(the best part for me), database management, sending mails with attachments and inline files. It also has Eloquent ORM(Object Relational mapping) which enables ease with database quering. It consists of Blade which is a template engine which file is saved as .blade.php extension. For Installing you need to download composer and using command line you can install laravel for a local project and can easily deploy that project using other Laravel projects.
