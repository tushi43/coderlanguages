	<h1><!--Name-->Node.js</h1>
	Node.js is one of most important javascript framework as it enables javascript to be used for server-side scripting. Before release of this framework javascript was only used for client-side scripting mainly for front-end only.
	Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.Node.js enables JavaScript to runs scripts on server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.Node.js has become one of the foundational elements of the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, allowing web application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.<br>
	Node.js can generate dynamic page content and also manipulate files on the server, It can also collect form data or add, delete, modify data in the database.<br>Node.js eliminates the waiting for server, and simply continues with the next request which saves time. Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

	<h1>Popular Applicatons</h1> 
	Many applications use Node.js because of its cool features,<br>
	example: Google, Yahoo, LinkedIn, GoDaddy, NetFlix, Walmart, Uber, Atom(with Electron), Microsoft Visual Studio code(website), Pok√©Dex Go Messenger Bot (website) and many more.<br>
