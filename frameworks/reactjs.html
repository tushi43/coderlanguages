<h1><!--Name-->React</h1>
React is a popular JavaScript library, not a framework but referred as framework. React allows developers to create large web-applications that use data and can change over time without reloading the page. It aims primarily to provide speed, simplicity, and scalability. React processes only user interfaces in applications. It is developed and maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React enables designing simple views for each state in your application. When web app is loading it shows black screen or some loading animation which makes user less interesting in app, React enable loading and loaded state so whenever slow internet connection is there it will show loading state(which is outline of loaded state, called as skeleton screens) and user attention is not diverted. using react reduces loading speed significantly from 8ms to 4ms it does not seem to much but affects on large scale apps. This is power of React. React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native. React has many uses which you can explore.
