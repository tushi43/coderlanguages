	<h1><!--Name-->Struts</h1>
	Apache Struts is a modern, maintained and full-featured web framework. Struts is java framework developed by Apache for web applications.  It uses and extends the Java Servlet API and provides Model View Controller(MVC) architecture. Struts can interact with standard data access technologies such as JDBC, as well as many third-party packages such as Hibernate, iBATIS, or Object Relational Bridge. For the view, Struts works well with JSP, including the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and JavaServer Faces (JSF), as well as Velocity Templates, XSLT, and other presentation systems. It is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with plugins to support REST, AJAX and JSON.<br>
	The framework provides three key components:<br>
	A “request” handler provided by the application developer that is mapped to a standard URI. A “response” handler that transfers control to another resource which completes the response. A tag library that helps developers create interactive form-based applications with server pages. The framework’s architecture and tags are buzzword compliant. Struts works well with conventional REST applications and with technologies like SOAP and AJAX.
