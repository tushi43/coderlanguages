	<br><br><br><h1><!--short intoduction--></h1><b>C</b> is one of the widely know languages because of its simplicity. C is simple,case-sensitive,structured programming language and only part which I think is complex is "Pointers".
	C is best language to understand basic syntax concepts like loops, conditions, basic data structures, different data-types and more. One should first learn all the language elements very thoroughly using C language before migrating to C++, C# or Java.<br>

	  <p class="mb-0" style="font-size:14px;">"You must have seen several professional 3D computer games
	where the user navigates some object, like say a spaceship and fires bullets at the invaders. The essence of all such games is speed. Needless to say, such games won't become popular if they takes a long time to move the spaceship or to fire a bullet. To match the expectations of the player the game has to react fast to the user inputs. This is where C language
	scores over other languages. Many popular gaming frameworks have been built using C language."</p>
