 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python</h1>
<br><br><br><h1><!--short intoduction--></h1>Python is one of the popular language because of less typing, Readability , performance.
Python emphasizes on code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.thus, beautiful code.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional and procedural.It is believed by many programmers that python
will soon take over java due to its performance,thus many people are learning python for this purpose. On its downside, The execution speed of python may not always be as fast as that of compiled languages such as C and C++. Python has been optimized numerous times, and python code runs fast enough by itself in most application domains  and where it does not extensions can be used for example <i>NumPy</i> turns python into numeric programming tool that is simultaneously efficient and easy to use. The PyPy can achieve 10X or 100X execution speed. Some Python implementations are CPython(The standard one), JPython(Python for Java), IronPython(Python for .NET), Stackless( for concurrency ), PyPy (Python for speed) and more.  <br> 
Some Real World examples where python is used:<br>
<i>Google</i> makes extensive use of Python in its web search engine.<br>
<i>YouTube</i> is largely written in Python. <i>Dropbox</i> storage service codes both its server and desktop client software primarily in Python.<br>
<i>BitTorrent</i> peer-to-peer file sharing system began its life as a Python program <br> <i>Maya</i>, a powerful integrated 3D modelling  and animation system provides a Python Scripting API.<br>
<i>iRobot</i> uses Python to develop commercial and military robotic devices.
<br> The <i>Raspberry Pi</i> single board computer promotes Python as its educational language.<br>
<i>Intel,Cisco,Hewlett-Packad,Seagate,Qualcomm,</i> and IBM use Python for hardware testing.<br> <i>JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Getco, and Citadel</i> apply Python to financial market forecasting.
