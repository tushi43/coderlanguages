	<br><br><br><h1><!--short intoduction--></h1>With Big Data, Data Analysis is becoming important and complex so R is used for this purpose.
	The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. R is free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.One of Râ€™s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.
