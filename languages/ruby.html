	<br><br><br><h1><!--short intoduction--></h1>Ruby is a programming language from Japan which is revolutionizing the web. The beauty of Ruby is found in its balance between simplicity and power. Ruby is said to follow the principle of least astonishment (POLA), meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Ruby is a pure and perfect object-oriented language. With introduction of JRuby and  Rubunius the two popular implementations of Ruby which are compiled versions, so there is confusion whether Ruby is compiled or interpreted. Ruby's still an interpreted language, or more precisely, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI), which is what people usually talk about when they talk about Ruby, is still an interpreter. The compilation step is simply there to reduce the code to something that's faster to execute than interpreting and reinterpreting the same code time after time. I have personally not used Ruby but have heard about it from starting of my engineering because of Ruby on Rails framework. It powers the Ruby on Rails (or Rails) framework, which is used on Scribd, GitHub, Groupon and Shopify. Like Python, Ruby is considered a fairly user-friendly language for beginners.
