 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL</h1><br>
 <b>S</b>tructured <b>Q</b>uery <b>L</b>anguage is a language used to create, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in Databases. In Relational DataBase Management System (RDBMS), data is stored in the form of tables and in each table columns acts as attributes and each row called tuple depicts a single record or data for a particular person or data-item. 
<h1>Developed By:</h1>	Created by Donald D. Chamberlin
Raymond F. Boyce, Developed by ISO/IEC
<h1>Released In:</h1> 1974.<br>
 SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation , data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. As the SQL acronym pronounces, it is a language. It offers looping, logic directives, variables, and so on. Now, it’s not a language in the same sense as, say, Java or C++: SQL is considered a fourth-generation language (4GL), whereas Java and C++ are third-generation languages (3GLs). Fourth-generation languages are programming languages that are closer to human language than high-level languages like Java. These 4GLs are often used to access databases, such as SQL, where humanlike syntax is used to retrieve and manipulate data. <br>
 SQL has three main statements for data manipulation they are INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. The most important statement in SQL is <b>SELECT</b> which is used to retrieve data and offers two main advantages: first, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command; and second, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index. SQL have Triggers, Events, Functions, Stored Procedures, and more. Triggers are fired when either insert, update or delete statement is fired. Events are fired in regular interval of time. Functions are called specifically and have some input and return a value or set of values. Many vendors provide database with their SQL with different features , they are  MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.
 
 
 Some of database management systems:
 <h1>MySQL</h1>
 MySQL is most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its is available free as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements . Primarily written in C, C++ and available for mostly every operating system and is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites, including Google(though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, LinkedIn, Paypal, Uber, Tesla, NetFlix, Paytm, Flipkart, YouTube, etc. MySQL is central main component in many of AMP stacks like XAMPP, LAMP. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation. It has Cross-platform support , Stored procedures, Triggers, Cursors, Updatable views and InnoDB Storage Engine for online DDL, provides security, Scalable.
 
 <h1>SQL Server</h1>
 MicroSoft has deveoped SQL server for its software applications for storing, manipulating and retrieving data initially released in 1989. It is also written using C and C++. Its cloud database based edition MicroSoft Azure is widely used.Heartland Bank, GE Healthcare, Bristow, NHS, Vodafone, Lufthansa systems, KPMG, Softtek, Quest, Dell and Cognizant etc use SQL Server.
 
 <h1>IBM DB2</h1>
 DB2 is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) from IBM. DB2 product is extended with the support of Object-Oriented features and non-relational structures with XML.
 
 <h1>Postgres/ PostgreSQL</h1>
 PostgreSQL is a powerful, object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. It has a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX  and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications (or for data warehousing) with many concurrent users; on macOS Server. Yahoo, Cisco, Skype, Apple, Sun Microsystems,etc uses PostgreSQL.
 
 <h1>Sybase</h1>
 Sybase is a relational database server owned by SAP which modernizes and dramatically speeds up transaction-intensive applications and meets new demands for performance, reliability, and efficiency. SAP Sybase ASE(Adaptive Server Enterprise) is more reliable online transaction processing (OLTP) for less cost.
 
 
 <br><br><h1>NoSQL</h1>
 As of 2017, almost all the big websites use some form of NoSQL database for their database needs. The database for these sites is so huge that a relational database can not handle it.
Some of the popular NoSQL database used by these big websites are:
Hadoop HBase, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon’s DynamoDB, Google’s BigTable.

 <br><h1>Future:</h1>
 <h1><a href="http://webscalesql.org/" class="a1"target="_blank">WebScaleSQL</a></h1>
 WebScaleSQL is a collaboration among engineers from several companies that face similar challenges in running MySQL at scale, and seek greater performance from a database technology tailored for their needs.
